face-api.js - JavaScript API for face detection and face recognition in the browser.

JavaScript emotion recognition API for the browser implemented on top of tensorflow.js core ([tensorflow/tfjs-core](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs))


## TO DO

- Turn on the Webcam  
- Turn on the Load Model switch to load the face detection pre-trained models
- Turn on the Detect Face switch to start detecting faces in your webcam
## Abstract 
Face recognition has existed in one form or another since the last century in the 1970s, and technological developments have led to the wide spread of this technology. This technology is no longer seen as something out of science fiction movies, and with scientific advances millions of people now have facial recognition technology in the palm of their hands, protecting their personal data and information. While mobile access control may be the most recognizable way to use facial recognition, it is used for a wide range of use cases including crime prevention, event protection, and making air travel more convenient. 
Face recognition is a part of the biometric technologies that has advantages for any broad objectivity in addition to low intrusion. It has the subtlety of a physiological method without discomfort. As a result, face recognition has attracted the attention of computer vision analysts in the fields of security, psychology, as well as image management.
This project focuses on several advanced Python libraries to improve face recognition accuracy such as OpenCV, Soar Cognitive Algorithm, and face_recognition. The project understands the data and the model, and trains it for further use. Real-time videos are taken into account to evaluate results. Furthermore, the project takes a look at emotion recognition algorithms using CV2, Soar Cognitive Algorithm. Areas of human faces are highlighted according to different emotions.

Keywords: affective computing, affect recognition, facial expression recognition, computational model of emotion, appraisal
